********************
BitML Toolchain
********************

|langname| is a domain-specific language for Bitcoin smart contracts, introduced in [CCS18]_.
The |langname| toolchain implements:

* an **IDE** for developing BitML contracts, integrated in the DrRacket IDE [RACKET]_;
* a **compiler** which translates |langname| contracts into *standard* Bitcoin transaction. The compiler is *computationally sound*, meaning that computational attacks (i.e., at the level of Bitcoin transactions) can be detected at the symbolic level of the BitML semantics;
* a **model checker** which verifies security properties of BitML contracts, like their *liquidity* (i.e., funds never remain frozen in a contract [POST19]_), and custom LTL properties. The model checker is based on Maude [MAUDE]_.
